# 🎓 COLLEGEhive – My Vision for a Smarter Campus

**COLLEGEhive** is a personal project I started to solve a common problem I faced as a student at **MITS Gwalior**—the scattered experience of accessing academic and campus resources across multiple platforms like Moodle, IMS, and the MITS website. This platform aims to **centralize everything students need**—notes, announcements, deadlines, forums—into a single dashboard.

I began this as part of my learning journey and hackathon participation, and even though it's just 5% done, it's a big step toward solving a real problem for thousands of students like me.

## 🚀 Why I’m Building COLLEGEhive

Students waste time jumping between different college portals.  
There's no unified place for announcements, class links, and study material.  
Communication between departments is fragmented.

**COLLEGEhive aims to:**
- 🧭 Act as a central academic dashboard  
- 📅 Offer a built-in planner and calendar  
- 📚 Provide department-specific resources  
- 🤝 Enable peer discussion and doubt-solving forums

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Frontend**: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, React (in future)  
- **Backend**: Node.js (planned)  
- **Database**: MongoDB or Firebase (planned)  
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (for static), Render or Railway (for backend)
